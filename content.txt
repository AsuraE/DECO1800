Yugara:

Location: 

Yugara a tribe of Australian Aboriginal people which inhabited the territories from 
Moreton Bay to Toowoomba including the city of Brisbane 
(including Ipswich) before European settlement of Australia.
This group is one of the traditional custodians of the land over which much of Brisbane is built

Language:
Yaggera is classified as belonging to the Durubalic subgroup of the Pama–Nyungan languages, 
but is also treated as the general name for the languages of the Brisbane area of which Turrbal 
has historically been considered a dialect.[4] The Australian English word 'yakka' 
(loosely meaning 'work', as in 'hard yakka') 
came from the Jagera language (yaga, 'strenuous work').

Turubul
Location: Brisbane area north to Caboolture and the Sunshine Coast.

Language:
Linguistic research, including AUSTLANG and AIATSIS indicate there is some 
uncertainty around Turubul including whether it refers to a dialect or a group 
within the North Brisbane Region. Historical documentation from settlers, missionaries 
and others record words from Turubul since the 1840s. There are shared words between Turubul and neighbouring languages of 
Kabi Kabi to the north and Yugara / Yuggera to the south.

butchulla:

Location: 
Butchulla lands were concentrated on in the centre of Thoorgine, or Fraser Island, and extended over 1,700 square miles 
(4,400 km2) to the coastal mainland (Cooloola[5]) south of Noosa.[3] The Butchulla route to the mainland ran through 
the lower waters of the Tinana Creek and their territory ran north to Pialba in Hervey Bay, and their borders to the 
west ran parallel to the upper Mary River.[3][6] To the southwest of their mainland territory were the Gubbi Gubbi,[6] 
with the territories of the Butchulla, Gubbi Gubbi and Dulingbara sometimes marked as meeting at Mount Bauple.[7] 
Some two decades after the arrival of Europeans, the original population of Fraser Island was estimated to be in the 
range of approximately 2,000 people, according to Archibald Meston,[8] a figure which, if true, would mean that the 
ecology was sufficiently rich in food resources to sustain one of the densest pre-contact populations of the Australian continent, 
paralleling only the Kaiadilt of Bentinck Island.[


Language:
The Butchella spoke Badjala, considered to have been a dialect of Gubbi Gubbi,[1] 
like other Fraser Island dialects.[2] Their ethnonym, variously transcribed as Butchulla/Batjala has 
been etymologized as signifying 'sea folk', though Norman Tindale suggested that the word better lends 
itself to an analysis as combining ba ('no') with the suffix tjala, meaning 'tongue'.[3] 
The Butchulla language is spoken in the Hervey Bay region inland towards Maryborough and Mt Bauple; as well as along 
the Fraser Coast, including Fraser Island
