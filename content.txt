Yugara:

Location: 

Yugara a tribe of Australian Aboriginal people which inhabited the territories from 
Moreton Bay to Toowoomba including the city of Brisbane 
(including Ipswich) before European settlement of Australia.
This group is one of the traditional custodians of the land over which much of Brisbane is built

Language:
Yaggera is classified as belonging to the Durubalic subgroup of the Pama–Nyungan languages, 
but is also treated as the general name for the languages of the Brisbane area of which Turrbal 
has historically been considered a dialect.[4] The Australian English word 'yakka' 
(loosely meaning 'work', as in 'hard yakka') 
came from the Jagera language (yaga, 'strenuous work').

Turubul
Location: Brisbane area north to Caboolture and the Sunshine Coast.

Language:
Linguistic research, including AUSTLANG and AIATSIS indicate there is some 
uncertainty around Turubul including whether it refers to a dialect or a group 
within the North Brisbane Region. Historical documentation from settlers, missionaries 
and others record words from Turubul since the 1840s. There are shared words between Turubul and neighbouring languages of 
Kabi Kabi to the north and Yugara / Yuggera to the south.
