		<h1>The Dream Team</h1>
		<p>The Dream Team is comprised of four people: Connor Cooper, 
			Victor Ngo, Aizel Redulla and Svetlana Vassilyeva.</p>
		<p>Connor is our technical implementation and JavaScript 
			coordinator and helps in allocating the necessary coding 
			tasks for the website.</p>
		<p>Victor is in charge of comprehensive user and technical 
			testing to make sure all decisions are justified and the 
			website works for every step of the implementation. </p>
		<p>Aizel is the project leader, primarily responsible for 
			coordination and organisation of the project as a whole. 
			She keeps track of the progress that has been made and 
			makes sure to resolve any problems that arise within the 
			team.</p>
		<p>Svetlana is our design director, responsible for overall 
			design decisions, including layout and visual organisation 
			or the pages and content, usability and visual aesthetics.</p>

		<h1>Our Project</h1>
		<p>Our website is made up of 2 main sections. The Learn 
			section allows students to learn the indigenous words 
			from the language dataset in 3 ways. The first allows 
			users to hover over an image of a body that will appear 
			with the indigenous words for each body part. The second 
			is a card matching game to match the English word to the 
			picture with the indigenous word. The third is the quiz 
			which gives students as well as teachers the ability to 
			track their progress, making Dreamtime a very useful tool 
			for the classroom.  </p>
		<p>The Language section provides interesting additional 
			information relating to each language and gives the 
			full wordlist available from the dataset. Teachers and 
			parents can access this section to determine whether a 
			certain language is suitable for what they would like to 
			teach to their children.</p>
